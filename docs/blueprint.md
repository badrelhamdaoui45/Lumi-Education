- Background color: Green. A light gray that provides a clean, neutral backdrop, ensuring readability and highlighting the content and the other colors.
- Accent color: Black. This gentle tan helps to warmly highlight specific elements without overpowering the serene color scheme. Use the colors in the logo.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text.
- Use clear, easily recognizable icons to represent different sections of the website (e.g., education, disability, poverty relief). Icons should complement the overall design, adding visual interest without being distracting.
- Maintain a clean, well-organized layout with a clear visual hierarchy. Key information, such as financial data and impact statistics, should be easily accessible and prominently displayed.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. For example, data visualizations could animate smoothly as they update. Animations should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.
